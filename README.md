EBRM is a recursive restoration model for image super-resolution
This repository is a try to implement the EBRM model through Tensorflow and Keras API.
The EBRM is reported in the original paper here (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9010860) and some review study shows its power in super-resolution.
