EBRM is a recursive restoration model for single-image super-resolution
This repository is a try to implement the EBRM model through Tensorflow and Keras API. As mentioned in the paper, the model was originally implemented on Pythorch, however their original code is not publicly available.

The EBRM is reported in the original paper here (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9010860) and some review study shows its power in super-resolution.

The jupyter file of Implementation_v02.1.ipynb is the start point.
